## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/yourusername/rentzambia/security/advisories/new) feature.

Alternatively, you can report security vulnerabilities by emailing [security@rentzambia.com](mailto:security@rentzambia.com).

The RentZambia team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will
keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
   released as fast as possible to npm.
