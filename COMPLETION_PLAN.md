# RentZambia - Implementation Completion Plan

## Current Status

The RentZambia project has a solid foundation with:
- Basic Next.js setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Authentication system (partially implemented)
- Tenant property search and browse functionality
- Landlord property management features
- Admin panel components
- Comprehensive documentation and testing setup

However, there are several critical issues that need to be addressed before the application can be considered complete.

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Webpack Runtime Error
**Problem**: There's a runtime error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours

**Solution Steps**:
1. Fix webpack configuration in `next.config.mjs`
2. Check for circular dependencies in components
3. Verify all imports are correctly resolved
4. Update dependencies if needed

### 2. Authentication Provider Error
**Problem**: There's a syntax error in `useAuth.ts` with JSX parsing
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Solution Steps**:
1. Fix JSX syntax in AuthProvider component
2. Ensure proper React context setup
3. Verify all authentication hooks work correctly

### 3. Missing Core Features
